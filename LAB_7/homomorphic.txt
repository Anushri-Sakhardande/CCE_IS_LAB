Paillier Cryptosystem:
The Paillier cryptosystem has the following homomorphic properties:

Additive Homomorphism:

Given two ciphertexts c1 = Enc(m1) and c2 = Enc(m2), the product of the ciphertexts is equal to the encryption of the sum of the plaintexts:
c1 * c2 = Enc(m1 + m2)


Scalar Multiplication Homomorphism:

Given a ciphertext c = Enc(m) and a scalar k, raising the ciphertext to the power of k is equal to the encryption of the product of the plaintext and the scalar:
c^k = Enc(k * m)

These homomorphic properties allow for operations on the ciphertexts that correspond to operations on the plaintexts, without the need to decrypt the ciphertexts.

ElGamal Cryptosystem:
The ElGamal cryptosystem has the following homomorphic property:

Multiplicative Homomorphism:

Given two ciphertexts (c1, d1) = Enc(m1) and (c2, d2) = Enc(m2), the component-wise product of the ciphertexts is equal to the encryption of the product of the plaintexts:
(c1 * c2, d1 * d2) = Enc(m1 * m2)

This means that multiplying the ciphertexts corresponds to multiplying the plaintexts, without the need to decrypt the ciphertexts.

RSA Cryptosystem:
The RSA cryptosystem has the following homomorphic property:

Multiplicative Homomorphism:

Given two ciphertexts c1 = Enc(m1) and c2 = Enc(m2), the product of the ciphertexts is equal to the encryption of the product of the plaintexts:
c1 * c2 = Enc(m1 * m2)



This means that multiplying the ciphertexts corresponds to multiplying the plaintexts, without the need to decrypt the ciphertexts.
